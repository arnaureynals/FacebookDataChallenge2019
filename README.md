# Facebook_Data_Challenge_2019

Facebook Data Challenge, which is a highly selective data competition, first launched in 2019 with the mission to provide real-world data science problem for data-enthusiast sophomores/juniors from different colleges all around U.S., Canada, and Mexico!

Within less than 24 hours, our team of 4 along with our Facebook Data Scientist mentor mined open data of San Francisco and came up with data-driven recommendations for opening new business in SF, and eventually providing insights for Facebook's product improvement. 

Leveraging our team diverse backgrounds, we were able to harness the good mix of Statistics, Economics, Computer Science and Engineering knowledge to create the most analytical and meaningful suggestions.
